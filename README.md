# Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-Algorithms-with-PyTorch

This repo is implementation for deep reinforcement learning algorithms in PyTorch.

## **Algorithms Implemented**
1. *Rainbow Deep Q Learning (DQN) (Just for Discrete)*

2. *A2C (Both for Continuous and Discrete)*

More RL algorithms will be added soon.
